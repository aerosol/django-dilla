Dilla is a multi-purpose general testing tool for automated
database spamming, intented to use with projects built on top of Django,
populating data within any number of internal applications.


Example settings.py
-------------------

  INSTALLED_APPS = ( ...
      'myapp',
      'dilla'
  )

  DICTIONARY = "/usr/share/dict/words"
  DILLA_USE_LOREM_IPSUM = False # set to True ignores dictionary
  DILLA_SPAMLIBS = ['myapp.my_custom_spammers'] # optional
  DILLA_APPS = ['myapp', 'auth']


Example usage & output
----------------------

   $ ./manage.py run_dilla --cycles=100
   Dilla is going to spam your database. Do you wish to proceed? (Y/N)Y
   Dilla finished!
        2 app(s) spammed 900 row(s) affected, 2498 field(s) filled, 502 field(s) ommited.

You may configure 'dilla' logger to get slightly more verbose output.
